    "# Providing Hyperparameter Search Example\n",
    "Here since we we are still using off-the-shelf preimplemented loss functions, but now since PG loss accepts two arguments ('h': width size, and 'finite_diff_type': finite different scheme}, we can search over the hyperparameters by inputting them into the `loss_configs` argument in the exaxmple below as: `{'PG': {'h':[num_data**-.125, num_data**-.25, num_data**-.5, num_data**-1], 'finite_diff_type': ['B', 'C', 'F']}}`. The pipeline function will use a helper function `lossfn_hyperparam_grid` to take the cartesian product of the `h` and `finite_diff_type` arrays."
