    2. If solver_batch_solve is True, it will passs the entire batch of data to the optimization model solver 
    otherwise it will call the optimization model solver for each data point in the batch
    
    Handling solver_kwargs:
    We expect solver_kwargs to be a dictionary of additional arrays of data that the solver may need, 
    ex: {'coef_matrix': [B, N, M]}, where B is the batch size, N is the number of rows in the matrix, and M is the number of columns in the matrix.
        In this case, solver_kwargs['coef_matrix'][i] will be the coef_matrix for the i-th data point in the batch.                    
    In this case, we will filter out the invalid arguments for the optimization model solver, 
    and then depending on solver_batch_solve:
        - if solver_batch_solve is True, we will pass the entire batch of data to the optimization model solver
        - if solver_batch_solve is False, we will call the optimization model solver for each data point in the batch
            by extracting the i-th data point from solver_kwargs for each key in solver_kwargs
            
    Args:
        optmodel (callable): optimization model
        pred_cost (dict): predicted coefficients/parameters for optimization model
        solver_kwargs (dict): a dictionary of additional arrays of data that the solver
            may need to solve the optimization model. For example, solver_kwargs could look like:
            {'coef_matrix': [B, N, M]}, where B is the batch size, N is the number of rows in the matrix, and M is the number of columns in the matrix.
            In this case, solver_kwargs['coef_matrix'][i] will be the coef_matrix for the i-th data point in the batch.
